# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
import math
### Step 2: 
get the values from the user.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4: 
print the result
 
### PROGRAM:

import math

x1,x2,y1,y2=10,4,6,2

dist=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)

print("{:.2f}".format(dist))
  


### OUTPUT:
![distance between two points.png](./images/distance%20between%20two%20points.png)


### RESULT:
Thus the python program to find the distance between 2 points was successfully executed
